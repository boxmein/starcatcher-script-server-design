Source code for future starcatcher.us/scripts/index.html

To use: 
=======


Go over main.js, Ctrl+F "TODO", there are a few things that you need to adjust
for it to work. Good luck!

Then, compile SASS into CSS, then use Myth.io or equivalent to prefix/add 
compatibility shims to it. I don't write my CSS with prefixes ;)

Optionally, minify Javascript. Make sure to change browse.html's link to
the new source file name then.

Then, simply place in /scripts/. Calls XMLHttpRequests to ./main.lua in the 
background.

Note: 
-----

Change to the Bright theme by editing the SASS `@import "style_dark";`, and 
then by editing the highlight.js colour theme stylesheet inside browse.html,
from "railscasts.min.css" to "github.min.css".

Double note:
------------

If you have inmake, simply run inmake on both browse.scss and main.js to do the
above automatically. Depends on the NPM package myth, Ruby gem sass and Google 
Closure Compiler.
